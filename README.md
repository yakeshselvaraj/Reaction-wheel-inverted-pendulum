# Reaction-wheel-inverted-pendulum
 inverted pendulum, which will be stabilized using a reaction wheel mounted at the end of the pendulum. Closed loop control of pendulum speed, pendulum position, reaction wheel speed, and reaction wheel position will be implemented through the use of a linear quadratic regulator in combination with a swing-up procedure. The pendulum will be mounted on the linear rail  and a joystick will be used to control movement of the linear rail. To demonstrate that there is no connection between the pendulum control and linear rail movement, a separate microcontroller will be used to drive the linear rail.
